# DSE-Intro-Refactor
Homework for Assignment #5


Refactoring an assignment I recently submitted for COSC 522. They basically wanted us to program our own decision tree classifiers and wanted everything in one single .py file so its big, messy, and generally hard to run through. On top of that, the code was hammered together over the last two days of it being due so it's more in a raw state and could definitely be improved.

Stored the original files in /original. Refactored code will sit inside /refactored.
